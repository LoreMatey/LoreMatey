# Hi, I'm Lorena! üëãüèª

I have just started my front-end developer career and I feel really excited to continue learning to code with good practices. As a Fine Arts graduate, I am passionate about nice-looking user interfaces. I love React.js, but I am open to learn other frameworks and languages.

## Skate-shop (personal project)

You can visit this link to see my first personal project https://sfake-shop.netlify.app/

This **React SPA** consists of a fake skateboarding shop with different sections (home, skateboards, sneakers, contact, login). It is **responsive** and it has been designed and developed following **mobile-first** philosophy.
